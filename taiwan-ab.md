自分の研究について300





私は、1990年代半ばから、若い日本人の香港や上海などアジア地域への移住を調査対象として研究を行ってきた。

同時にこの時期には、日本で暮らし、働く外国人が増加に注目が集まり、多文化社会の課題に関心を向ける研究者が増加した。他方で、日本人の海外移住は、「自分探し」や「キャリア構築」など、個人的な目的による行為と見なす人が多く、当初はあまり国際移動に関する議論と結びつけられることはなかった。

しかし、日本からの海外移住も、円高、日本経済のグローバル化、旅行や留学を含む海外渡航の大衆化などを背景としている。また、日本の職場や家族関係におけるジェンダー秩序により、女性が仕事を続けたり、責任のある地位に就くことが難しかったこと、こうした職場のジェンダー分業が，日本的なものとされてきたために、「海外」へ行けば，日本とは異なるジェンダー関係の元で働けるという期待があった。他方で、私の調査地である香港や上海では、多くの女性が、日系企業で働いていたために、ジェンダー分業はある程度維持されていた。たとえば、男性が、給与や福利厚生、仕事の安定性が高い駐在員として日本の本社から派遣されていたのに対し、女性は現地採用で働くことが多かった。こうした女性の海外就労に対し、メディアは、誤った期待に基づく移住だというスタンスを取ってきたが、彼女たちが、海外日系企業の経営に果たしてきた役割を過小評価すべきではない。

この事例はまた、グローバル化が進み、企業の経営や働き方が変化していくことを、個人がどのように経験し、言語化したのかを理解するのにも役に立つ。仕事の進め方や家族の持ち方は、この30年の間に大きく変化した。そのなかで移住や帰還を決断する人々の語りは、グローバル化をミクロな視点で再考するにあたり、重要な示唆を与えてくれる。



Since the mid-1990s, I have been conducting research on the migration of young Japanese to places in Asia such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
At the same time, there was an increase in the number of foreigners living and working in Japan, and the number of researchers focusing on the issues of multicultural societies also increased. On the other hand, many people saw Japanese emigration overseas as an act motivated by personal goals such as “self-discovery” or “career building”, and it was not initially linked to discussions of international migration.
However, emigration from Japan overseas is also taking place against a backdrop of a strong yen, the globalization of the Japanese economy, and the popularization of overseas travel, including travel for study abroad. In addition, due to the gender order in Japanese workplaces and family relationships, it was difficult for women to continue working or to take on positions of responsibility, and because this gender division of labor in the workplace has been considered to be uniquely Japanese, there was an expectation that if they went “overseas,” they would be able to work under a different gender relationship than in Japan. On the other hand, in Hong Kong and Shanghai, where I conducted my research, many women worked for Japanese companies, so the gender division of labor was to some extent maintained. For example, while men were often dispatched from the Japanese head office as expatriates with high salaries, benefits and job security, women were often hired locally. The media has taken the stance that these women's overseas employment is based on misguided expectations, but we should not underestimate the role they have played in the management of overseas Japanese companies.
This case also helps us to understand how individuals experience and verbalize the changes in corporate management and work styles that have occurred as a result of globalization. The way we work and the way we have families has changed significantly over the past 30 years. The narratives of those who have made the decision to migrate or return provide important insights when reconsidering globalization from a micro perspective.





Since the mid-1990s, I have researched the migration of young Japanese individuals to cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai. Concurrently, the number of foreigners in Japan has risen, alongside a growing focus on multicultural issues. Initially, many viewed Japanese emigration as driven by personal goals like “self-discovery” or “career building,” with little connection to broader international migration discussions.

However, this emigration has been influenced by factors such as a strong yen, globalization of the Japanese economy, and increased opportunities for overseas travel and study. In Japan, workplace gender dynamics and family structures often hinder women from advancing in their careers. Many believed that working abroad would offer better gender relations. Yet, in Hong Kong and Shanghai, where I conducted my research, women frequently worked for Japanese companies, perpetuating existing gender roles. Men were typically dispatched as expatriates with substantial salaries and benefits, while women were often hired locally.

Media narratives often portray these women's overseas employment as based on unrealistic expectations, but their contributions to managing overseas Japanese companies should not be underestimated. This case sheds light on how individuals navigate and articulate the shifts in corporate management and work styles due to globalization. Over the past 30 years, work and family dynamics have changed significantly, and the experiences of those who choose to migrate or return provide critical insights into globalization from a micro perspective.

The ways we work, and structure families have transformed dramatically over the past three decades. Those who migrate or return have invaluable insights to offer for a rethink.

# Women’s career and family relations in globalizing Japan

Since the mid-1980s, there has been a noticeable and significant increase of foreigners living and working in Japan, alongside a rise in research focused on multicultural realities of various aspects of Japanese society. At the same time, the number of Japanese who reside in foreign countries also increase; however, many incorrectly assumed that Japanese contemporary emigration was driven primarily by personal aspirations such as "self-discovery" and "career building," which led to a disconnect with broader discussions on international migration.

I have researched Japanese migrants in Hong Kong and Shanghai since 1996. They said that their motivation of migration was personal, but It is clear that the emigration of Japanese individuals has been also influenced by economic and political system, including a strong yen, the globalization of the Japanese economy, and the growing popularity of overseas travel and study. Furthermore, the persistent gender division within Japanese workplaces and family structures actively impede women's career advancement and ability to assume leadership roles. This led to the belief that relocating abroad would provide women with the opportunity to engage in different gender dynamics. This division also make women's wokring experience abroad diffrent from those of men. For example, while men were typically sent abroad as expatriates with attractive salaries and benefits, women were often hired locally, reflecting ongoing disparities.

The Japanese media often portrays women's migration to Asian cities as a "boom", driven by the false expectations that women could work more equally to men; However, women's contributions to Japanese firms abroad are substantial and deserve recognition.  This case sheds light on how individuals navigate and articulate the shifts in corporate management and work styles due to globalization. Over the past 30 years, work and family dynamics have changed significantly, and the experiences of those who choose to migrate or return provide critical insights into globalization from a micro perspective.
