**Inclusion and Exclusion: How Educational Organizations Deal with Diversity**

Organizations, as important societal structures, both create and address social inequities. They regulate inclusion and exclusion processes, shaping individuals' access to opportunities and resources, thereby influencing the construction and understanding of dis/ability, gender, ethnicity, age.

This stream examines how organizational practices affect the lives of people who are put into disadvantaged categories – e.g., people with disabilities, people of color, people of non cis-male gender. Organizations such as schools, businesses, political entities, sports associations, and mass media shape social inclusion and exclusion, producing inequalities. These inequalities manifest through differentiated educational outcomes, employment disparities, political representation, competitive success, and media visibility. Exclusion from these organizations often translates to exclusion from societal participation, impacting individuals' access to education, employment, sports, and other social spheres –resulting in inequity.

This stream´s objective is to identify stakeholders affected by these organizational dynamics, especially in educational organizations, and assess the implications for understanding the production of inequity based on social categorizations such as dis/ability, gender, ethnicity, and age. By examining how organizations perpetuate inequalities through inclusion and exclusion mechanisms, we aim to uncover the barriers faced by people put in disadvantaged categories and explore opportunities for creating a more inclusive society.

This session asks questions like:

- Who is affected by exclusionary practices in educational organizations like kindergardens, preschools, daycare centers, schools, universities, colleges, and other education centers and programs?
- How are educational stakeholders affected by exclusionary practices?
- How do exclusionary practices look like and how do they perpetuate?
- Which solutions against exclusionary practices can be identified?





学校への欠席は、制度として学校がつくられるのと同時に、社会的な問題として、議論の対象となってきた。学校を通じて子どもたちは教育や訓練を受け、初等教育から中等、高等教育へと段階を踏んで進んでいく。各段階での卒業資格は一定の教育課程を納めた証拠としてよりよい職業へのルートとなり、また様々な社会生活を営むためのネットワークの獲得に結びつく。そのため、学校への継続的な欠席は子どもにとって否定的な効果をもたらす可能性が高い。

日本では、9年の義務教育ののち、9割以上の子どもが高等学校に進学し、さらに半数以上が高等教育を受けている教育システム。

文部科学省が学習内容や教科書に至るまで、細かく制度を決めている。その結果、日本の教育制度は居住地域や家族の環境にかかわらず、一定の質を保っており、そのことは、子どもの平均的な学力水準の高さにも表れている。他方で、学校での教員の労働環境、いじめなどの問題は、以前から事件が起こるたびに出ていたが、この10年ほどは、少子化で子ども数が減少しているにもかかわらず、不登校の生徒が増加し続けていることが問題になっている。

不登校はかつては、生徒自身の問題行動とみなされ、学校に来られない子どもに対しては、教員や保護者が登校を促し、それでも登校しなければ、成績や進学に大きなペナルティが生じていた。だが、実際には不登校の原因は様々であり、子ども自身の発達障害や、家族内の問題に加え、学校システム自体が社会の変化に対応できていない可能性もある。

文部科学省は、2016年に、不登校の生徒を学校に戻すことをゴールとするのではなく、様々な制度や設備を利用し、義務教育段階の教育機会を確保することを法律で定めた。その結果、学校での別室登校や教育支援センターなどの制度を整えたり、民間のフリースクールを活用することで、学校に行きづらい生徒の学びを認可したり、ICT技術を用いて、遠隔で学べる仕組みを作るなどの改革を進めてきた。

だが、実際にはこの制度は必ずしもうまくいってない。理由はいくつかある。1つは一本化された教育制度自体は大きくは変わっておらず（外国人学校なども認められていない）ため、伝統的ではない学校や教育機関の設置は大都市に偏っていたり、費用が高額だったりする。また、複線化したルートにはなっていないため、非伝統的な教育経歴を、伝統的な学校が認可するかどうかはわからない。伝統的な学校の教員やそこに通う生徒、保護者のなかには、依然として不登校を、本人の怠惰さや親の無責任のせいだと考える傾向もある。また、学校に適応できない子どもやその保護者は、どのように教育を受け、子どもを社会化していくのかを自分で情報収集して、決めていかなくてはならない。

本報告では、日本社会の不登校の現状を、マクロなデータや、不登校をめぐる報道や当事者の手記、さらに実際に不登校の子どもをもつ保護者の視点からのオートエスノグラフィカルなデータを用いて明らかにする。また近年の教育行政における肯定的な変化とともに、今後の課題を論じ、他の国や地域における教育と比較していく。

The Rise of School Absenteeism in Japan 



The number of students who don't attend the compulsory schools has risen rapidly in Japan. Approximately one in twenty students are absent from school for more than 30 days a year, and despite the declining number of students due to the declining birthrate, the number of truant students has increased by about three times.

おおよそ20人に1人の生徒が、年間30日以上学校を欠席しており、少子化により生徒数が減少しているにもかかわらず、不登校生徒の人数は3倍ほど増加した。

In Japan, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) regulates the content of study and even the textbooks in great detail. As a result, the Japanese education system maintains a certain level of quality regardless of the region of residence or family circumstances, and this is reflected in the high average academic ability of children; However, schools outside the system, such as international schools and their students, have been excluded from the official curriculum.

日本では、文部科学省が学習内容や教科書に至るまで、細かく制度を決めている。その結果、日本の教育制度は居住地域や家族の環境にかかわらず、一定の質を保っており、そのことは、子どもの平均的な学力水準の高さにも表れている。しかし、外国人学校など、制度の外側にある学校やそこに通う子どもは、正規の教育課程から排除されてきた。

不登校はかつては、生徒自身の問題行動とみなされ、学校に来られない子どもに対しては、教員や保護者が登校を促し、それでも登校しなければ、成績や進学に大きなペナルティが生じていた。だが、実際には不登校の原因は様々であり、子ども自身の発達障害や、家族内の問題に加え、学校システム自体が社会の変化に対応できていない可能性もある。

In the past, absenteeism from school was considered to be a problematic behavior of the student themselves.When children were unable to come to school, teachers and guardians would encourage them to attend, and if they still did not attend, there would be significant penalties for their grades and future education.

However, the actual situation is that the causes of school non-attendance are diverse, and in addition to developmental disorders in the child themselves and problems within the family, it is also possible that the school system itself is unable to respond to changes in society.
In 2016, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology established a law that aims to secure educational opportunities during the compulsory education stage by making use of various systems and facilities, rather than setting the goal of returning students who are not attending school to school. Aspart of this, they have been promoting reforms such as establishing systems such as separate rooms in schools and educational support centers, and authorizing learning for students who have difficulty attending school by making use of private free schools, as well as creating systems that allow students to learn remotely using ICT technology.



However, in reality, this system is not always working well. There are several reasons for this. One is that the unified education system itself has not changed significantly (foreign schools, etc. are not recognized), so the establishment of non-traditional schools and educational institutions is biased towards large cities and the costs are high. Also, because it is not a multi-track route, it is not known whether traditional schools will recognize non-traditional educational backgrounds. There is also a tendency among teachers, students and parents at traditional schools to still think that truancy is due to laziness on the part of the student or irresponsibility on the part of the parents. In addition, children who are unable to adapt to school and their parents must gather information and make decisions on their own about how to educate and socialize their children.
In this report, we will clarify the current situation of truancy in Japanese society using macro data, media reports on truancy, personal accounts from those involved, and auto-ethnographic data from the perspective of parents with truant children. We will also discuss the positive changes in recent years in education administration and the issues that lie ahead, and compare education in Japan with that in other countries and regions.

In Japan, the number of students who are absent from school is approximately one in twenty students, three times more than that of. 10 years ago. The Ministry of Education ensures that every detail of the curriculum is meticulously planned and that textbooks are carefully selected. This ensures that regardless of one's geographical location or familial circumstances in Japan, the educational system will maintain a consistent level of quality. This is reflected in the high average academic ability of children in Japan. However, educational establishments operating outside the system, such as international schools, and their students, have not yet been incorporated into the official curriculum.The school abssntism was previously regarded as a matter affecting solely the individual student. In the event of a child being unable to attend school, teachers and guardians would encourage them to do so. Should the child still fail to attend, significant penalties would be imposed on their grades and future educational prospects.

However, It is not merely a matter of the child exhibiting developmental challenges or confronting domestic difficulties. In 2016, the Ministry of Education enacted legislation with the objective of ensuring access to educational opportunities during the compulsory education stage. This was to be achieved by utilising a range of systems and facilities, as opposed to focusing on the re-integration of students who are not attending school. In order to achieve this, various reforms have been implemented, including the establishment of dedicated spaces within educational institutions and the creation of educational support centres. Additionally, students who face challenges in attending school have been provided with the option to pursue their studies at private free schools. Furthermore, systems have been developed that facilitate remote learning through the use of ICT technology.

One issue is that the unified education system itself has not undergone significant transformation, resulting in the establishment of non-traditional schools and educational institutions being concentrated in large cities and associated with high costs. Furthermore, as the route is not multi-track, it is unclear whether traditional schools will recognise non-traditional educational backgrounds. Furthermore, there is a prevailing perception among educators, students, and parents in conventional educational settings that abssentism must be primarily a consequence of student apathy or parental negligence. Furthermore, children who are unable to adapt to school and their parents must independently gather information and make decisions regarding the education and socialisation of their children.
This report will discuss the present state of abssentism in Japanese schools through an examination of macro data, media reports on truancy, personal accounts from those affected, and auto-ethnographic data from the perspective of parents with truant children. Additionally, it will discuss the positive developments in recent years in education administration and the challenges that remain, and compare Japanese education with that in other countries and regions.
